## 🌱 Inspiration

The idea for **Numerify** was born after I learned about the **Richmond Foundation**,  
founded by **Akshata Murty**, which focuses on empowering communities through education, mental health, and social inclusion.

Her vision — *to create a society where everyone has the confidence to learn, grow, and contribute* — deeply inspired me.  
I realized that while literacy often receives attention, **numeracy** (the ability to confidently work with numbers)  
is just as vital, yet often overlooked.

So I decided to build **Numerify** — a platform where learning mathematics isn’t intimidating,  
but **interactive, joyful, and confidence-building**.

> “If literacy gives you a voice, numeracy gives you confidence.”  
> — The guiding principle behind Numerify
